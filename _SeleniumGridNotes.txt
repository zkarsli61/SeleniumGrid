What is Selenium Grid? 
	https://www.browserstack.com/guide/selenium-grid-tutorial

	Selenium Grid is a smart proxy server that makes it easy to run tests in parallel on multiple machines. 
	This is done by routing commands to remote web browser instances, where one server acts as the hub. 
	This hub routes test commands that are in JSON format to multiple registered Grid nodes.

When should testers use Selenium Grid?

	To run tests on multiple browsers and their versions, different devices, and operating systems
	To reduce the time that a test suite takes to complete execution
